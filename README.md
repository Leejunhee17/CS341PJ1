# CS341PJ1
This repository contains a project for the CS341 course, which focuses on the fundamentals of computer networks. The project demonstrates a simple client-server program written in C to illustrate socket programming, data transmission, connection handling, and basic error management.

## Project Overview
### Client Application:
The client initiates a connection to the server, sends data, and receives responses. It is responsible for handling user input and displaying the serverâ€™s replies.

### Server Application:
The server continuously listens for incoming client connections, processes the received data, and sends back appropriate responses. It includes basic error handling and connection management.
